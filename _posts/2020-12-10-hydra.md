# [Hydra](https://github.com/rocharhs/hydra)

Hobby project to test A.I code, specially *reinforcement learning* algorithms.

A self-playing snake game.

Each snake is an autonomous agent that knows
  - the position of the food
  - its own position and color
  - the color of each block on the world

The reward is
  - $$1$$: if it eats an apple
  - $$-1$$: if it dies

The round winner is the the last one standing

you can run the simulation with

```
python game.py
```

*press S key* to slow-down the simulation, which also trigger the sound effects
*release S key* to go back to normal


You can implement your own snake brain and put it on a snake inside *game.py*


The following is an example of a brain


```python
import numpy as np
from snake_brain import Brain

class GreedyBrain(Brain):
    # Loves apples and gardens
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def update_direction(self, world_view, snake_head, snake_color):

        food_pos = np.array(world_view.get_food())
        snake_pos = np.array(snake_head)

        desired_dir = food_pos - snake_pos
        row_dir = desired_dir[0]
        col_dir = desired_dir[1]

        #vertical priority [rows]
        if np.abs(row_dir) > np.abs(col_dir):
            if row_dir > 0: #must add rows
                return 'DOWN'
            else:
                return 'UP'
        else:
            if col_dir > 0:
                return 'RIGHT'
            else:
                return 'LEFT'
    # Snake feedback
    def update_brain(self, reward):
        pass
```

Make snake brains for fun!
